			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>My name is Connor Rudisill and I am a current Freshman at the University of South Carolina.  I am from a small town in North Carolina called Morganton.  I am a biological sciences major with a minor in medical humanities and culture and am on the pre-med track. I currently am a undergraduate research assistant in the Neurodevelopmental Disorders Lab here at USC.  I also am a part of the South Carolina honors college here at the university.</p>		
			<p id="part2" class="hidden">I have always been a huge sports fan so in my free time I enjoy playing and watching just about any sport. I also really enjoy spending time outside either fishing or just going for a walk.  I currently play on an intramural soccer team here at USC.  I also enjoy just casually hanging out with my family and friends.  One of my favorite things to do with them is play cards.  Our favority games are rook, spades, and setback.</p>

			<h3>My Future Career Plans</h3>
			<p>As mentioned above I am on the pre-med track.  I have always enjoyed helping others and I feel there is no better way to help someone then to help them live a healthy life.  I have always loved being around children and this has drawn me to the field of pediatrics.  I currently am involved in several job oppurunties helping children such as a basketball and scocer official and as a subsitrute teacher.  </p>
			<p id="2part" class="hidden">This summer I plan to shadow a pediatrician as well as vounteer at a free medical clinic.  This summer I will also be beginning my MCAT preperation.  Eventually, as a pediatrician, I would like to own my own practice and help make a difference keeping children healthy.  In particular I would like to help serve the rural areas of the southeast.  One thing I have learned in my studies is how rural healthcare can be in the south.</p>
